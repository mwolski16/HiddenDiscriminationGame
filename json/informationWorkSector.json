        "In most countries, the share of women working in the public sector is higher than the share of women working in the foraml private sector. Public = 41% and Private = 38%",
        "The gender pay gap is ten percent lower in the public sector than the formal private sector. Women's average wages are 86% of male wages in the public sector, as compared to 76% of male wages in the formal private sector.",
        "The public sector pays a higher wage premium to women than to men. Across all countries, women recieve a public-sector wage premium of 27%, as compared to 19% for men. These differences can be driven by occupational sorting: women may sort into ceratin occupations, such as teaching and nursing, which have higher premium.",
        "While women are well represented in the public sector, they are underrepresented at the top. Women occupy less than 30% of 'senior official' positions in the public sector, while representing around 50% of clerical positions.",
        "The female-to-male wgae disparity is not reflected to the level of income of a country. The gender wage gap exists in the vast majority of countries, an contrary to what we might think, richer coutnries do not neccesarily do better when it comes to equal pay. This means that gender parity does not simply come with economic development but will require targeted policies to achieve."
